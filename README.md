(With extra information)

## Solutions:

1. VERY BAD: "*Just* go to /Workspace/ie-titanic-utils"
  -Con: Your user will start polluting everything
2. QUITE BAD: I send the file (str_utils.py) and the user puts it in their working directory
  -Con: If they are working on several directories you don't control your code anymore
3. A LITTLE BIT BAD: Change "sys.path"
  -Con: Users use the development version
4. EXCELLENT: Attending the rest of the course
